### Pseudo API for this chess_game_engine

```javascript
let game = new Game();

// start the game, `start` also starts a counter.
game.start(); // with white
// The player should make a move.

game.start_with(White / Black);

// checks who's turn is this
let who = game.whose_turn(); // white/black

// show a visual representation of chess through stdout
game.show_board();

// to select a character //if this engine doesn't provide GUI selection, replace select with move
let character = game.select(Pawn(1, G)); // warns if not legal 

// List out possible moves for selected character.
let moves = character.possible_moves();

// Move the character to a new position,
// In case of a valid move, it spits out the effect
// otherwise throws an error.
// also makes the timer stop.
let res = character.move_to(2, G); // ok/err

// can't select a character if you don't switch sides.
game.select(Pawn(2, G)); // warns since turn over.

// changes the side to get select working again.
// also starts a counter.
game.change_side();

let who = game.whose_turn(); // white/black

game.request_draw();

game.resign();

game.is_game_over();

game.check_winner();

game.can_pawn_promote();

game.undo();

game.review();

game.save(); // saved Algebraic Notations.
